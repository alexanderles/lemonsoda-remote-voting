# LemonSoda Cross-Chain DAO Voting Protocol
 
## High Level Description
LemonSoda is a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) voting protocol that enables members to cast their votes on proposals from other blockchains. By utilizing the power of Axelar’s cross-chain infrastructure, LemonSoda allows DAO members to vote on governance proposals while simultaneously interacting with DeFi protocols on other non-native blockchains.

The LemonSoda interface provides an easy and seamless experience for members to call a specific DAO proposal smart contract on whichever blockchain the governance vote is taking place. Members can state their voting preference (yes, no, abstain) for the proposal in question as well as the number of tokens they wish to send. Once the transaction is confirmed, LemonSoda sends the members' data across chain where their vote is recorded.

In its current iteration, LemonSoda burns members' tokens once their vote is cast. However, future iterations, the protocol will enable fresh tokens to be minted and sent back to the DAO member in accordance with the specific voting rules of the DAO in question.

One of the primary advantages of LemonSoda's cross-chain governance protocol is that DAO members can bridge their governance tokens to other chains for use as collateral on DeFi platforms, liquidity in DEX's, avoid high gas fees, etc, while still retaining their voting power. Without LemonSoda, DAO members are often limited in what they can do with their governance tokens, as they are forced to keep them on the native DAO chain to prove their membership status and vote on proposals, or bridge back and forth whenever a new voting period is started.

Overall, LemonSoda provides a powerful solution for DAO’s and their members looking to expand to other blockchains. By utilizing cross-chain communication, LemonSoda enables a seamless and secure process for members to vote on proposals from other blockchains while still maintaining their membership status within the DAO.
